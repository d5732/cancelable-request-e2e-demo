          <H2>Why Would You Want to Cancel a Request?</H2>
          <P sx={{ mb: 2 }}>
            Imagine an e-commerce website like Amazon with a dynamic product
            search bar. When a customer begins typing into the search bar, the
            frontend immediately sends out HTTP requests for autocomplete
            suggestions and potential product matches. Each keystroke
            potentially triggers another request‚Äîeven before the previous ones
            have finished processing.
          </P>

          <P sx={{ mb: 2 }}>
            Most modern browsers limit concurrent connections to{" "}
            <b>6 per server</b>. This is in compliance with HTTP/1.1
            specifications (

              rel="noopener noreferrer"

              RFC 7230
            </a>
            ) which state that "a client ought to limit the number of
            simultaneous open connections that it maintains to a given server."
            This limitation presents challenges for these dynamic UIs. The
            browser's connection limit can cause requests to pile up in a queue,
            increasing wait times.
          </P>
          <P sx={{ mb: 2 }}>
            Even within the connection limit, multiple requests can produce race
            conditions on the frontend, because responses may be returned out of
            order. This can lead to unexpected behavior.
          </P>
          <P sx={{ mb: 2 }}>
            To avoid these issues, we can cancel requests which are no longer
            relevant. The{" "}

          <H2>The AbortController Problem</H2>

          <P sx={{ mb: 2 }}>
            AbortController is a double-edged sword. While it allows the
            frontend to cancel requests, it doesn't automatically cancel the
            corresponding backend operations. This can create dramatic spikes in
            the number of concurrent requests your backend is handling, because{" "}
            <b>
              canceling requests effectively bypasses the browser's native
              throttling of concurrent same-origin connections.
            </b>
          </P>
          <P sx={{ mb: 2 }}>
            A common mitigation strategy is to make backend operations as
            efficient as possible, and simply allow the backend to complete
            unnecessary operations for each canceled HTTP request. However, this
            may not always be sufficient. At a certain scale, regardless of
            optimization efforts, unnecessary operations would still be costly.
          </P>
          <P sx={{ mb: 2 }}>
            Additionally, especially in distributed systems, there are often
            organizational and technical roadblocks, where more conventional
            solutions could be outright prohibited, e.g., changes to the schema,
            architecture, etc.
          </P>
          <P>
            In these extreme scenarios, we can consider another strategy:{" "}

            and RxJS. Consider that future newcomers to your project may be
            unfamiliar with this paradigm, which may raise your project's
            barrier to entry.

          <H3>Connection Pool Management</H3>
          <P>
            The <code>pg_cancel_backend</code> query requires its own database
            connection, and must be executed swiftly to fulfill the intended
            purpose of freeing database resources as soon as possible. Thus, you
            must ensure connections will be readily available to handle query
            cancellation to achieve the performance benefits. Consider using a
            dedicated connection pool for cancellations.
